This repository contains the code for adaptiveMSA, a modified version of UPP that uses J-score instead of bitscore for assigning query sequences to HMMs 
in the UPP algorithm.  

In order to install adaptiveMSA, follow the instructions for installing UPP in the flie tutorial/upp-tutorial.md, with the exception that  

git clone https://github.com/smirarab/sepp.git

should be replaced with:

git clone https://github.com/ilanshom/adaptiveMSA.git
